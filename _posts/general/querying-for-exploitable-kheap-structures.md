# Foreword

One of the biggest difficulties that I've faced as a beginner trying to get into Kernel Exploitation would be not knowing what exploitable heap structure I can use for any given heap-based vulnerability.

In fact, this is most certainly not a novel research topic. [ptr Yudai](https://x.com/ptryudai), who is highly respected in the exploit community, has also tackled this problem successfully using the Ghidra scripting engine.
