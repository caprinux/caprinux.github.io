<!-- 
What happens when we break compiler conventions? What happens if you modify registers that do not belong to you?

With the rise of MCPs and LLMs, the landscape of reverse-engineering has changed significantly and traditional reverse-engineering has been made more trivial than ever. In the context of CTFs, when writing reversing challenges, I aim to bring across learning challenges that are relevant to the real world to the participants. The over-reliance on LLM has kept me questioning about how I could force participants to understand the fundamentals of assembly and reverse-engineering.

Personally, I have much appreciation for the low-level mechanisms that our programs are built upon. My pursuit to understand these mechanisms often leave me with many questions on what happens if we challenge the different conventions and assumptions that compilers build upon.

That's why I wrote a post about how we can achieve control flow obfuscation by modifying callee-saved aka non-volatile registers. I also showcased a proof-of-concept where I was able to entirely hide blocks of code from the disassembler and obfuscate the control flow that executes the hidden code.

I tried to make it as beginner-friendly as possible, so I hope that someone on this platform would have a fun read on their daily commute! :)

I've always had much appreciation for all the low-level things from assembly to compilers and more. In my pursuit to better understand these mechanisms, I'm often left with many questions on what happens if we challenge the different assumptions and conventions that our compilers are built upon.

In this post, we will question the following conventions and break some assumptions made by disassemblers/decompilers to obfuscate control flow and hide code!

**What happens when we break compiler conventions?**

**What happens if you modify registers that do not belong to you?**

## Proof of Concept (PoC) 

Before we dive into the details, let me first share a snippet of the proof of concept! You can find the binary [here](./helloworld.elf).

As you can see, the program is pretty small and the main function does nothing except `put("Hello world!")` and it does not have many defined functions as well.

![poc](poc1.png)
_disasembly of the main function_

Probably, the most "out of the ordinary" function would be `frame_dummy` that is typically overlooked since it exists in most ELF binaries as some sort of a placeholder function.

![poc](poc_frame_dummy.png)
_disasembly of the frame\_dummy function_

However, if you run the program with the correct parameters, it will print `nice!`.

```
‚ùØ ./helloworld.elf
Hello world!

‚ùØ ./helloworld.elf sctf{going_beyond_hello_world_1z2ket65cx3sdxfjb}
nice!
Hello world!
```
{:file="bash"}

Where in the code does it even check for the command line argument, and prints `nice!`??

## Compiler Convention on x64 Registers

For those with some assembly knowledge, we often know of registers simply as a variable that stores a value.

Some registers are known as special-purpose registers, 

- `RIP`: Holds the address of the next instruction to be executed
- `RSP`: Holds the address of the top of the stack frame _(modifiable via `PUSH`/`POP`)_

while the rest are often simply called general purpose registers that we can also classify as caller/callee-saved registers.

![callee-vs-caller-saved-registers](cmu-notes.png)
_reference: <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15411-f20/www/rec/f20-05-sol.pdf">Notes from CMU Compiler Design Class</a>_

Variables in our programs are typically either stored on the stack or in registers.

Variables in the stack will need to be read and updated through stack dereferences which becomes inefficient for variables that are frequently used throughout a function.

As such, callee-saved registers are sometimes used by the compiler to improve efficiency of the program.

> Sometimes, caller-saved registers are **also called volatile registers** since the value of these registers are volatile and may be modified after a function call.
> 
> Conversely, callee-saved registers are **also called non-volatile registers** since the values of these registers are not modified after a function call.

## Case Study: Calling constructors in Ubuntu's GLIBC

This idea for obfuscation first came to mind when I was debugging GLIBC internals one day, specifically how constructors are called from `__libc_start_main`. Here's the snippet of code responsible for calling the chain of constructors.

```nasm
; snippet of assembly code taken from __libc_start_main (ubuntu glibc 2.35)

loc_29EA8:                              
                mov     rdx, [rsp+48h+var_48]
                add     r14, 8 ; get next constructor

loc_29EB0:                              
                mov     [rsp+48h+var_48], rdx
                mov     rsi, r12 ; prepare argv
                mov     edi, ebp ; prepare argc
                call    qword ptr [rcx] ; call the constructor
                mov     rcx, r14
                cmp     [rsp+48h+var_40], r14 ; checks if any constructors left
                jnz     short loc_29EA8
```

Essentially, there are **3 callee-saved registers** used here.

| register | purpose |
| - | - |
| EBP | `argc` - the number of command line arguments the program is executed with |
| R12 | `argv` - the list of command line arguments the program is executed with |
| R14 | the address where the list of addresses of the constructors are stored |

Additionally, `var_40` stores the address of the last constructor in the list of constructors _(defined in .init\_array)_ and `var_48` stores the pointer to the list of environment variables _(aka `char* envp[]`)_.

The assumption here is that these registers will not be changed by the constructor functions. However, if we are able to modify `r14`, we could possibly **repeat constructor functions** or even **call a different function by writing into R14**!

### Endlessly looping our constructor

By analyzing the assembly above, we can see that it is running in a loop where `r14` is the loop index and `r14 != var_40` is the terminating condition.

We can modify `r14 -= 8` to make it call the same constructor over and over again!

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// r14 -> pointer to constructor array
// r12 -> pointer to argv
// ebp -> argc

int __attribute__((naked)) __attribute__((constructor)) func1() {
        write(1, "func1 called\n", 14);
        __asm__(
                ".intel_syntax noprefix\n"
                "sub r14, 8\n"
                "ret\n"
                ".att_syntax\n"
        );
}
int main() {
        puts("hello world");
}
```

If we try to compile and run the above function, it will re-run the constructor and print `func1 called` forever.

### Call a different function

If we go through an extra step to modify the pointer within `r14`, we can achieve calls into other functions.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// r14 -> pointer to constructor array
// r12 -> pointer to argv
// ebp -> argc

void __attribute__((used)) secret() {
        puts("secret");
}

int __attribute__((naked)) __attribute__((constructor)) func1() {
        __asm__(
                ".intel_syntax noprefix\n"
                "sub r14, 8\n"
                "sub qword ptr [r14], func1-secret\n" // we want to find a way to hide this
                "ret\n"
                ".att_syntax\n"
        );
}
int main() {
        puts("hello world");
}

```

Running the above program will give us this result

```
‚ùØ ./a.out
secret
hello world
```

And let's look at how this looks like in a decompiler!

![img](poc_hidden_call.png)

Although it looks suspicious due to the red font in the decompilation, it is not immediately obvious what this code is doing especially since the logic that executes the `secret` function is hidden within the library code that is not visible in the decompiler.

By building on top of this small poc, we can create larger programs that will be a pain to reverse due to the difficulty in identifying the program flow.

## Bonus - How do we further hide our "malicious" code?

We've managed to obfuscate our control flow by continuously modifying the constructor chain pointer and the constructor address within it.

How can we further make our compiled program more discreet and not draw attention to the constructor modifying assembly snippet?

### Hide the initial jump in a 'default' function

By default, ELF files compiled in GCC contains the `frame_dummy` function which is executed as a constructor function.

![img](frame_dummy.png)

This commonly seen function has become an easily overlooked function by reverse engineers.

As such, if we could fit out callee-saved register modifying piece of assembly code within this function, it would be a perfect hiding place.

To achieve that, I patched the compiled binary to

- Fill up the original `frame_dummy` with a bunch of random bytes
- Add `jmp register_tm_clones` to the end of my assembly snippet
- Patch `SYMTAB` to set the address of `frame_dummy` to my assembly snippet

### Hide the initial jump from being decompiled

If we were to write a constructor with the following piece of assembly code,

```
sub r14, 8
add QWORD PTR [r14], 1337
ret
```

This would be easily recognized and decompiled by tools like IDA to display the following, which might raise suspicion.

```c
void __fastcall func1()
{
  __int64 v0; // r14

  *(_QWORD *)(v0 - 8) -= 26LL;
}
```

However, if we messed up the assembly to look weird enough _(and still accomplish the same effect)_, IDA will actually ignore it and not decompile anything! :)

In this specific case, we can use `push` and `pop` to effectively do any read/write.

![img](poc_messy_assembly.png)

Sick!

### Hide the main shellcode from disassembly

By default, IDA will sweep the bytes in the `.text` section to try to identify and disassembly any assembly code.

This makes it difficult to discreetly weave in shellcode that we can jump to.

To solve this, we can actually simply add a bunch of random bytes before the shellcode so that IDA will give up on disassembling the entire chunk of bytes.

```
# add some junk bytes before
strip_dumb:
	.string "\x0e\xe9\x86\xf1/l\xdc\xaa/OZ>\xf9\xbd\xff\x10y\xc6\xf9\xe4"

# make RWX memory so we can decrypt our memory inplace
strip_make_rwx_memory:
	lea rsi, [rip]
	mov edi, 0xfff
	not rdi
	and rdi, rsi
	lea rbx, [rip+frame_dummy]
	xor rdx, rdx
	xor rsi, rsi
	xor rax, rax
	mov si, 0x1000
	mov dl, 0x7
	mov al, 0xa
	syscall
 
	# jmp to next part of shellcode
	xchg rsp, r14
	sub rsp, 8
	pop rax
	sub rax, strip_make_rwx_memory-strip_decrypt_memory_init
	push rax
	xchg rsp, r14
	ret

# add some junk bytes after
strip_dump2:
	.string "\x9f\xb6LAJVH#T\xc1\x14-\x81v\xcc\xe9\x8dPP\x8a"
```

### Stripping unwanted symbols 

When writing my shellcode, I made use of many symbols that would make reversing much more trivial if they are left within the program.

However, I did not want to entirely strip the program as that would remove symbols like `main` and `frame_dummy` which would prompt the reverse engineer to manually reverse every function.

As such, I prefixed all my symbols with `strip_` and manually parsed the symbol table to remove entries that begin with `strip_`.

The final script can be found later

### Encrypt our shellcode

To further discourage IDA to disassemble our shellcode, I also encrypted most of my shellcode at runtime.

I used a script to encrypt the bytes between the symbols `ENCRYPT_BEGIN` and `ENCRYPT_END` and included a decrypting routine at the start of the shellcode.

```
lea r8, [rip+ENCRYPT_BEGIN] # begin of encryption area
lea r9, [rip+ENCRYPT_END] # end of encryption area
lea rbx, [rip+frame_dummy] # xor key

# we implement our memory decryption here
strip_decrypt_memory_init:
	mov al, byte ptr [rbx]
	xor [r8], al
	inc rbx
	inc r8

	xchg rsp, r14
	sub rsp, 8
	pop rax
	cmp r8, r9 # if r8 == r9
	jnz strip_l20
	add rax, strip_check_flag_init-strip_decrypt_memory_init
strip_l20:
	push rax
	xchg rsp, r14
	ret

```

The loop is also implemented by deciding using a comparison to decide whether to modify the constructor pointer.

## The ugly patching code

Finally, here's the super super ugly code that I used to patch the ELF to look as "Hello World" as possible :)

```py

## Conclusion

By utilizing callee-saved registers from library functions, we were able to create an **invisible** jump that executes some shellcode discreetly.

While this is not any ground-breaking research, such research is fun and interesting as it gives us insights into how compilers and our reverse-engineering tools work and might even be useful by helping us understand and prepare for more complicated low-level assembly tricks that might be used in malware to achieve code obfuscation.

In my next obfuscation adventure, I hope to be able to do less manual work and directly instrument the assembly code on the compiler level, possibly through writing LLVM passes.

Hopefully this was a good read and see you in the next one!
