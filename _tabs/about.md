## whoami

I'm Elma (he/him), an average Singaporean pre-university student who enjoys CTFs. ðŸ¤“

This blog serves as a way to keep myself accountable for my learning and to share cool stuff.

I usually play with [r3kapig](https://r3kapig.com/) and [NUS Greyhats](https://nusgreyhats.org).

## contact me

Feel free to reach out to me via [Discord](https://discord.com/users/191550739666042880), [X](https://x.com/elma_ios) _(formerly twitter)_ or [Email](mailto:root@elmo.sg)!

I typically enjoy getting to know and conversing with new people (as long as you're not a creep...) ðŸ˜Š
